  abstract = {Alternative (alt) text is essential for people with visual impairments to acquire information about image content through a screen reader. However, collecting images and creating alt text requires time and effort. To deal with this problem, automatically collecting images that have no alt text is essential to ensure that all image content in a web page has their alt text. Additionally, automatic alt text has limitations in accuracy and quality compared to human-created alt text despite the improvements in image recognition and natural language process technology. We present WATAA, a web alt text authoring assistant that collects images containing no alt text and suggests automatic alt text to help human alt text authors improve a web page’s accessibility.},

  abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) gives many benefits to our lives. However, biased AI models created by receiving data poisoning attacks may induce social problems. Therefore, developers must consider carefully whether the training data received a poison attack when developing an AI model. Data visualization is one of the methods to facilitate the analysis of the data required for checking if the training data received a poisoning attack. However, prior studies did not visualize real-world AI training data. Restaurant reviews in delivery apps are one of the cases of a poisoned dataset. Restaurants hold review events on delivery apps to encourage customers to write a positive review in return for certain rewards, thereby creating reviews with bias. In this study, we propose POisoned Real-world Data Explainer (PORDE) that explains data poisoning attacks through visual analytics with food delivery app reviews. The findings of this study suggest implications for securing safe training data and developing less biased AI models.},

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein, A. and Podolsky, B. and Rosen, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
